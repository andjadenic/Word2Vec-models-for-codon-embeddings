# Exploring Word2Vec Models for Capturing the Similarity of Codon Embeddings

### Word2Vec Model
[Word2vec](https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4546), is a neural network (NN) technique, that learns a vector representation of
words (tokens), analyzing its context (surrounding tokens), and use some function between
vectors to encode the semantic relationship between words.
